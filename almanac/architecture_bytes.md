### Architecture Byte
**Circuit Breaker Pattern** — Fail fast when downstream services are unhealthy. Monitor error rates and latency, trip on thresholds, then half-open to probe recovery. Prevents cascading failures and improves system resilience.

### Architecture Byte
**Monolith vs. Microservices** — A monolithic application is built as a single, unified unit. Microservices architecture is an approach where a large application is built as a suite of modular services. Each service runs in its own process and communicates via APIs.

### Architecture Byte
**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** — CQRS is a pattern that separates read and write operations for a data store. Commands update data, while Queries read data. This can help optimize performance, scalability, and security.
