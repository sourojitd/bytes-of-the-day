### Mindset
**Mindset: You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)** — The YAGNI principle states that you should not add functionality until it is deemed necessary. It's a key tenet of Extreme Programming (XP) to avoid over-engineering and wasted effort.

### Mindset
**Mindset: The Boy Scout Rule** — Leave the codebase healthier than you found it. Every time you touch a piece of code, take a moment to clean it up, refactor a small part, or improve its readability. This leads to gradual, sustained improvement.

### Mindset
**Mindset: Rubber Duck Debugging** — Explain your code, line-by-line, to a rubber duck (or any inanimate object). The act of verbalizing your thought process often helps you find the flaw in your logic on your own.

### Mindset
**Mindset: Premature Optimization** — Donald Knuth famously said, 'Premature optimization is the root of all evil.' Don't spend time optimizing code before you know where the performance bottlenecks are. Write clean, working code first, then optimize based on measurement.

### Mindset
**Mindset: Technical Debt** — Technical debt is the implied cost of rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. Like financial debt, it accrues 'interest,' making future changes harder.
