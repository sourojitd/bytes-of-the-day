### Dev Tips
**Idempotent APIs** — Ensure that your API endpoints are idempotent, especially for write operations. Making the same call multiple times should produce the same result as making it once. This is critical for reliable distributed systems.

### Dev Tips
**Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** — Adopt Semantic Versioning for your projects. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the: MAJOR version for incompatible API changes, MINOR version for backward-compatible functionality, and PATCH version for backward-compatible bug fixes.

### Dev Tips
**Use Environment Variables for Configuration** — Never hardcode configuration like database credentials or API keys in your code. Use environment variables to manage configuration for different environments (development, staging, production).

### Dev Tips
**Write Meaningful Commit Messages** — A good commit message explains the 'what' and the 'why' of a change, not just the 'how'. Follow conventions like the 50/72 rule (50-char subject, 72-char body lines) for clarity.

### Dev Tips
**SOLID Principles - Single Responsibility** — The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change. This makes your code more modular, easier to understand, and less brittle.
