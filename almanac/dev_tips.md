### Dev Tips
**Idempotent APIs** — Ensure that your API endpoints are idempotent, especially for write operations. Making the same call multiple times should produce the same result as making it once. This is critical for reliable distributed systems.

### Dev Tips
**Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** — Adopt Semantic Versioning for your projects. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the: MAJOR version for incompatible API changes, MINOR version for backward-compatible functionality, and PATCH version for backward-compatible bug fixes.
